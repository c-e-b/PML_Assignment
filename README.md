Practical Machine Learning Assignment

In this repo you can find my writeup as .html, .pdf and .Rmd. Enjoy.

Please note that the calculated accuracy while knitting became a little bit different, than what I wrote inside the Rmd file (and that got into the written parts in the html and pdf). Because the calculation of the rf model takes pretty long and would have to run again to knit a new version, I will keep this small „mistake“. It doesn’t influence the resulting prediction.
